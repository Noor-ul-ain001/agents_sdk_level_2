Handling sensitive data in AI agent development is a critical challenge, and different SDKs offer various strategies, from data masking to encryption hooks and strict permission controls. The core principle is to treat the LLM as an untrusted component and protect data throughout the agent's lifecycle.

The table below summarizes the security features and approaches of several major agent development platforms.

| **SDK / Platform** | **Primary Security Mechanism** | **Key Features** | **Use Case Focus** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Google Agent ADK** | Lifecycle Callbacks for Encryption | `before_tool_callback`, `after_tool_callback` for strategic decryption/encryption; Model-level guardrails. | Custom, code-based agent development. |
| **ServiceNow (Now Assist)** | Real-time Data Masking & Anonymization | Data Privacy for Now Assist; Anonymizes PII in prompts; Replaces original data in responses. | Enterprise workflows within the ServiceNow platform. |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | Tracing & Guardrails | Input/Output guardrails with tripwires; Configurable tracing to exclude sensitive data from logs. | General-purpose AI agent applications. |
| **Microsoft 365 Copilot / SharePoint Agents** | Permission Inheritance & Access Control | Inherits user's existing Microsoft 365 permissions; Relies on data sensitivity labels and DLP policies. | Microsoft 365 ecosystem and productivity tools. |
| **Strands Agents SDK** | Model-Agnostic Security | Can be integrated with various security providers; Focus on isolating tool execution. | Flexible, model-agnostic agent development on AWS. |
| **Tencent Cloud Agent Platform** | Comprehensive Data Security | Encryption at rest and in transit; RBAC/ABAC; Data masking; Audit and monitoring. | Enterprise-grade secure agent development on Tencent Cloud. |

### üõ°Ô∏è Key Security Strategies and Principles

Beyond specific SDK features, securing agent interactions relies on several fundamental strategies.

- **Data Masking and Anonymization**: This involves replacing real sensitive data with fake but realistic placeholder values or tokens before they are sent to the LLM. ServiceNow's Data Privacy for Now Assist is a prime example of this approach, ensuring the model never sees the actual sensitive information.
- **Encryption Hooks**: Instead of masking, you can encrypt data before it enters the agent's workflow and only decrypt it briefly when absolutely necessary. The Google Agent ADK callback system is designed for this, allowing you to decrypt data just before a tool uses it and re-encrypt it immediately after.
- **Strict Access Control and Auditing**: AI agents inherit the user's permissions. A user with over-provisioned access can cause an agent to inadvertently expose sensitive files from unrelated departments or projects. Adhere to the **principle of least privilege** and conduct regular permission audits. Platforms like Tencent Cloud enforce this with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and detailed audit logs.
- **Input/Output Guardrails**: These act as safety filters. **Input guardrails** validate or sanitize initial user requests, while **output guardrails** scan the agent's final response for potential data leaks before it is sent to the user. The OpenAI Agents SDK supports these guardrails, which can halt execution if a tripwire is triggered.

### üí° Recommendations for Implementation

To build secure agents, you should:

- **Audit Permissions First**: Before deploying any agent, conduct a comprehensive audit of user data access rights to eliminate unnecessary permissions.
- **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure agents and users have only the minimum access needed for their specific tasks.
- **Enable and Configure Security Features**: Remember that data masking and privacy features are often not enabled by default. You must actively configure them based on your organization's data policies.
- **Implement AI-Specific Monitoring**: Use Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools and monitor for AI-specific interactions with sensitive data, as traditional security tools might miss these nuances.

The best approach for you will depend on the specific SDK you are using and your application's environment.

- If you are building custom agents with **Google Agent ADK**, study the callback system for fine-grained encryption control.
- For **ServiceNow** users, focus on configuring "Data Privacy for Now Assist" for seamless data masking within your workflows.
- If you are using a general-purpose SDK like the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, prioritize setting up robust **guardrails** and reviewing your **tracing** configuration to prevent sensitive data from being logged.
