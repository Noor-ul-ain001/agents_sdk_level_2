
# Reasoning in Prompts: Advanced Techniques for AI Agents

This guide covers sophisticated reasoning techniques and prompt engineering strategies to enhance AI agent capabilities in the OpenAI Agents SDK.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Reasoning Patterns

### Structured Reasoning Approaches
| Pattern | Purpose | Key Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chain of Thought (CoT)** | Step-by-step reasoning for complex problems | Explicit intermediate steps, logical progression |
| **Tree of Thought (ToT)** | Multiple reasoning paths with evaluation | Parallel reasoning branches, quality assessment |
| **Graph of Thought (GoT)** | Complex reasoning with interconnected steps | Networked reasoning, cyclical dependencies |
| **Self-Critique** | Error detection and correction | Reflection, verification, iterative improvement |
