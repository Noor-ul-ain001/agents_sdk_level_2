# Sync vs Async Tool Integration in OpenAI Agents SDK

The OpenAI Agents SDK provides comprehensive support for both synchronous and asynchronous tool integration, allowing you to choose the right approach based on your application's needs and performance requirements.

## ðŸ”„ Core Concepts

### Execution Models
| Aspect | Synchronous Tools | Asynchronous Tools |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Execution** | Blocking - runs in main thread | Non-blocking - runs in event loop |
| **Performance** | Suitable for CPU-bound operations | Ideal for I/O-bound operations |
| **Complexity** | Simpler to implement and debug | More complex but more scalable |
| **Use Cases** | Simple calculations, data processing | API calls, database queries, file I/O |


## ðŸ“Š Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Approach
- **Use Synchronous Tools For**:
  - CPU-intensive calculations
  - Simple data transformations
  - Operations with minimal I/O
  - Quick, deterministic functions

- **Use Asynchronous Tools For**:
  - Network requests (APIs, web scraping)
  - Database operations
  - File I/O operations
  - Any operation with waiting periods
