| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Keyword-Based** | Pre-defined rules/if-else statements match keywords. | Simple, predictable, fast. | Brittle; fails with synonym or complex queries. | Simple, well-defined categories with fixed vocabulary. |
| **LLM-Based** | Uses an LLM to analyze the semantic meaning and context of the entire query. | Handles ambiguity and complex, multi-intent questions. | Higher latency and cost; potential for hallucinations. | Complex enterprise assistants and multi-domain queries. |
| **Context-Based** | Routes based on the system's state (e.g., variables, user data). | Dynamic; enables state-aware workflows (e.g., escalation). | Requires engineering to manage and update context state. | Multi-stage support tickets, premium customer routing. |

### üö´ Key Limitations of Keyword-Based Routing

The core problem with keyword-based routing is its lack of semantic understanding. It operates on a literal matching of words, which leads to several issues:

*   **Poor Handling of Ambiguity and Synonyms**: If a user says, "My internet is down," but the rule only looks for the keyword "connection," the query will be misrouted or not routed at all. It cannot understand that "internet is down" and "connection problem" express the same intent.
*   **Inability to Manage Complex, Multi-Intent Queries**: A user might ask, "Compare our performance of Q1 and Q4 in the last year and draft a financial analysis document." This single query contains elements for a data analysis agent, a finance agent, and a document-writing agent. A keyword-based router would struggle to decompose this and route it effectively.
*   **Rigidity and Scalability Issues**: Each new capability or agent requires adding new, hard-coded rules. This system becomes difficult to maintain and scales poorly. Adding a new specialist agent, like a "legal agent," means updating all routing logic to include relevant legal keywords.
*   **Lack of Conversational Context and State**: It cannot make decisions based on the conversation's history or external state. For example, it cannot detect a frustrated customer through sentiment or recognize that a user is repeating an issue, which are key triggers for a handoff to a human agent.

### üõ†Ô∏è Pathways to More Advanced Handoffs

To overcome these limitations, you can move towards more intelligent routing strategies:

*   **Implement LLM-Based Routing**: Using an LLM as the "decision layer" allows the router to understand the user's intent and context. In the OpenAI Agents SDK, you can configure handoffs where the LLM decides which specialized agent to invoke based on its analysis of the entire conversation.
*   **Adopt a Hierarchical or Manager-Based Pattern**: This involves a top-level "manager" or "orchestrator" agent that uses an LLM to interpret requests and delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents. This pattern is powerful for complex workflows and is supported by SDKs like the Claude Agent SDK and the OpenAI Agents SDK.
*   **Integrate State and Context Awareness**: Incorporate context variables, such as `is_premium_customer` or `issue_escalation_count`, into your routing logic. This allows for handoffs based not just on the user's words, but on the system's state.
*   **Engineer a Hybrid Approach**: You can start with a simple rule-based system for common, clear-cut cases and have a fallback to an LLM-based router for ambiguous or complex queries. This can help balance cost, latency, and capability.
