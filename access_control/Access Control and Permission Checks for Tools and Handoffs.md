# Access Control for AI Agents - Simple Guide

## What is Access Control?
**Access control** decides which agents can use which tools and see which data. It's like giving different keys to different people in a company.


### 2. **Level-Based Access**
```
Level 1: Read public data
Level 2: Read internal data  
Level 3: Read confidential data
Level 4: Read secret data + Edit data
```

## Simple Examples

### Example 1: Research Team
```
Researcher Agent → Can: search web, read documents
                  Cannot: delete files, access finances

Analyst Agent → Can: read research, analyze data
               Cannot: edit source documents

Writer Agent → Can: write reports, read analysis
              Cannot: change raw data
```

### Example 2: Customer Service
```
Tier 1 Agent → Can: view basic customer info, create tickets
Tier 2 Agent → Can: access order history, process returns
Manager Agent → Can: everything, including override actions
```

## Key Rules to Remember

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Give agents only the access they absolutely need
2. **Separation of Duties**: No single agent should do everything
3. **Audit Trail**: Log who did what and when

## Why It Matters
✅ **Security** - Prevents unauthorized actions  
✅ **Safety** - Avoids costly mistakes  
✅ **Compliance** - Meets legal requirements  
✅ **Reliability** - Makes system more predictable
