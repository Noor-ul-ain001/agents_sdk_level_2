# Agent Cloning, Copying, and Replication in OpenAI Agents SDK

This guide covers various techniques for creating agent copies, including cloning, shallow copying, and advanced replication patterns for building scalable multi-agent systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Concepts

### Copy Types Overview
| Method | Depth | Use Case | Performance Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent.clone()** | Deep copy with overrides | Creating modified variants of existing agents | Moderate (creates new objects) |
| **copy.copy()** | Shallow copy | Quick duplicates sharing some references | Fast (minimal object creation) |
| **copy.deepcopy()** | Deep copy | Complete independent copies | Slow (full object tree copy) |
| **Template Pattern** | Structural replication | Creating agent factories and prototypes | Fast after initial setup |
