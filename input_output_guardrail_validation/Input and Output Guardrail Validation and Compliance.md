Guardrails act as programmable safety checks that run in parallel to your main agent. They are categorized based on when they act during the agent's processing cycle.

| Guardrail Type | Purpose | Execution Timing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input Guardrails** | Validate, filter, or screen the initial user input. | Run **before** the main agent processes the request. |
| **Output Guardrails** | Validate, filter, or screen the agent's final response. | Run **after** the main agent has generated its output. |

The primary goal of input guardrails is to **prevent misuse and save resources** by stopping off-topic or malicious queries before they reach a potentially expensive main agent. Output guardrails serve to **ensure safety and compliance**, for instance, by preventing the leakage of sensitive information like Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in the agent's responses.

### üö® The Tripwire Mechanism

The core of the guardrail system is the **tripwire**. If any guardrail sets `tripwire_triggered=True`, the SDK immediately halts the agent's execution by raising a specific exception:
- An `InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` exception for input guardrail violations.
- An `OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered` exception for output guardrail violations.

This mechanism ensures that invalid inputs or unsafe outputs stop the process early, protecting your system and saving resources.

### üìú Compliance in Multi-Agent Systems

In more complex, multi-agent systems, ensuring compliance involves additional challenges and requires a structured technical framework.

- **Distributed Accountability**: It can be difficult to trace how a decision was made across multiple autonomous agents. Implementing **tamper-evident logging** that captures the identity, actions, and full sequence of interactions for each agent is crucial for audits.
- **Cross-Agent Data Governance**: Data flowing between agents can lead to compliance issues (e.g., with GDPR or HIPAA). Implement **persistent data classification tags** that travel with the data and policy enforcement points between agents to verify handling permissions.
- **Inconsistent Security**: Different agents may have different security postures. A federated identity and access management system can enforce the **principle of least privilege** across all agent interactions.
- **Emergent Behavior**: Unpredictable behaviors can arise from complex agent interactions. **Automated continuous monitoring and chaos engineering** can help detect compliance drift and test system resilience under failure.
