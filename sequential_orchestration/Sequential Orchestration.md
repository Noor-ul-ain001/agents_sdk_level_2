# Sequential Orchestration - Simple Explanation

## What is it?
**Sequential orchestration** means running AI agents one after another in a specific order, like an assembly line.

```
Input → Agent 1 → Agent 2 → Agent 3 → Final Result
```

## How It Works

### Basic Example: Writing a Report
```
Research Agent → Analysis Agent → Writing Agent → Final Report
```

1. **Research Agent** finds information
2. **Analysis Agent** processes the data
3. **Writing Agent** creates the final document

### Simple Code Example
```python
# Define the sequence
def simple_workflow(topic):
    research = research_agent(topic)      # Step 1: Research
    analysis = analysis_agent(research)   # Step 2: Analyze
    report = writing_agent(analysis)      # Step 3: Write
    return report
```

## When to Use It
- **Tasks have clear steps** (A must happen before B)
- **Simple workflows** without complex decisions
- **Predictable processes** where you know the exact sequence

## Benefits
✅ **Easy to understand** - Clear step-by-step flow  
✅ **Reliable** - Less complex than other patterns  
✅ **Easy to debug** - You know exactly where something failed  

## Common Use Cases
1. **Customer support**: Receive → Classify → Route → Solve
2. **Content creation**: Research → Outline → Write → Edit
3. **Data processing**: Collect → Clean → Analyze → Report

## Key Points to Remember
- Each agent waits for the previous one to finish
- Data flows from one agent to the next
- If one agent fails, the whole process stops
- Easy to set up and monitor
