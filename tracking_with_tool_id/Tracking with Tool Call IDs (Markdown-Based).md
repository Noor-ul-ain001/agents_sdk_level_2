
The following table compares how different SDKs implement and utilize Tool Call IDs:

| Framework / SDK | Core Tracking Mechanism | Key Features for Tool Call Correlation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OpenAI Agents SDK** | Built-in tracing with `function_span()` | â€¢ Automatic tracing of function tool calls<br>â€¢ Tool calls and results linked within a trace<br>â€¢ `ToolContext` potentially provides call context |
| **LangGraph** | `ToolMessage` with `tool_call_id` field | â€¢ `ToolNode` executes calls and returns `ToolMessage`<br>â€¢ Explicit `tool_call_id` links results to specific calls<br>â€¢ Built-in error handling returns error `ToolMessage` |
| **AI SDK Core** | `steps` property and `onStepFinish` callback | â€¢ Access to intermediate `toolCalls` and `toolResults` per step<br>â€¢ `onStepFinish` callback for step completion logic |

### ðŸ’¡ Implementation Insights

Based on the SDK mechanisms, here is how you can effectively track tool calls:

- **For Comprehensive Auditing:** The OpenAI Agents SDK's built-in tracing is a robust solution. It automatically captures a timeline of all events, including each tool call and its result, which is ideal for debugging and monitoring in production.
- **For Custom Workflow Control:** If you are building a custom agent with a defined graph structure, LangGraph's `ToolMessage` and `ToolNode` offer a clear, manual way to track the lifecycle of each call using the provided `tool_call_id`.
- **For Multi-Step Reasoning:** When an agent requires multiple tool calls to answer a single query, the AI SDK Core's `steps` property allows you to introspect the entire chain of tool calls and results that led to the final answer.
