Feature gating is a software development technique that controls user access to specific features based on criteria like their subscription plan, making it a cornerstone of modern SaaS pricing and packaging strategies. It allows you to align your product offerings with different customer needs and budgets, creating clear upgrade paths.

The table below summarizes some of the leading tools available in 2025 that can help implement these strategies.

### üèóÔ∏è Common Implementation Approaches and Pitfalls

There are several technical ways to implement feature gating, each with its own trade-offs.

- **The Problem with Simple Plan Identifiers**: A common but brittle approach is to check a user's subscription plan ID directly in your code. This tightly couples your code to your pricing model, meaning every pricing change requires a code deployment and becomes difficult to maintain.
- **Using Feature Flags for Entitlements**: Feature flag tools provide a more dynamic method to toggle features, but they were often designed for short-lived operational controls (like rollouts) rather than long-term monetization. Using them for subscriptions can require custom workflows to keep flags in sync with billing systems.
- **The Modern Way: Entitlements**: This concept refers to the specific rights and permissions granted to a customer as part of their subscription. **Entitlements** are designed to decouple your pricing model from your application code. They provide a centralized system to define "what a customer can do," making it easier for non-engineering teams to manage without constant developer intervention.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Best Practices

- **Decouple Access from Pricing**: Instead of hardcoding plan IDs, build your checks around the feature access itself (the entitlement). This allows you to change your pricing and packaging without touching the codebase.
- **Combine with a Subscription Billing System**: For a complete solution, you need a backend system that manages customer subscriptions, plans, and payments. When a user's subscription changes, this system should trigger an immediate update to their entitlements.
- **Use a Layered Access Check**: A robust access control flow often involves multiple checks:
    1.  **Feature Flag**: Is the feature actively developed and enabled for anyone?
    2.  **Entitlement Check**: Does this customer's subscription include this feature?
    3.  **User Permission (AuthZ)**: Does this specific user within the account have permission to use the feature?
